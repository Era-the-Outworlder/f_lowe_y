"Some more handy resources about surfaces.txt can be found where FLELE shell makers congregate, namely at shell-collectors on devart. So here are a few links to some tutorials about surfaces.txt that may come in handy, you may want to read these and then come back and tackle surfaces.txt with new ideas if you're feeling adventurous."
